grasp the gist and basic of the passage. But go swiftly once the core is grasped. Read
actively but efficiently.

Be emotional but not in a state of prejudice
or pretend to be in the situationin the passage. Since we can't understand carefully

the passage, then, come up with a simple story. Be careful of the constrast or shift
of attitude.

Principle#3: Unpacking the beginning
The beginning is important, but might be extremely esoteric due to 
cramming of acadamia jargon. But don't be frightened. Try to abridged the sentence
with plain english and skip the jargon because it is not necessary to know for 
understanding the passage.

Linking is a powerful technique. Keep linking the sentence that comes up to the 
sentences we have just read. Figure out the purpose of the sentence.
